# sparta-global-rockpaperscissors

This repo was created for a homework in Week 3 of the Sparta bootcamp.

The aim of this homework was to complete a functional game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using HTML and Javascript.

The game allows the player to continuously play rounds against a randomised computer opponent and keeps track of the current score.
